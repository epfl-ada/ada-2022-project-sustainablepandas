# Project Title

## Abstract

Beer is one of the most popular beverage and is consumed worldwide. With this in mind, we are interested to analyze and depict the type of consommation across the world,
that is, which kind of beers are consumed and prefered in which country. Being provided with datasets of two beer reviews websites, we have access to a huge amount of data about 
beer ratings from users from everywhere in the world. The goal would be to create an interactive spatiotemporal map showing which is the favourite beer style 
of each country, starting from the earliest reviews available until 2017. It will help us to determine the preference and trend in beer consumption for the analyzed period of time,
and we will try to explain the reasons behind it. We will use google maps API to localize more precisely the breweries across the world.
