## Abstract

Breweries are becoming more and more popular nowadays with a rising interest for beers. When starting a new brewery, the choice of location of the brewery is a significant step to guarantee its success. This projects aims to give advice to new brewers and indicate if they should install themselves in a crowded city or in the calm countryside. A look will also be given into beer styles and what are differences can be found between beer crafted in urban area and in rural area. We will go though a large dataset on beer reviews provided by the [RateBeer website](https://www.ratebeer.com/) which collected over 7 millions reviews for a period of 17 years (2001-2017). 


## Research questions

- Are there major differences between urban and rural breweries? 
- Do breweries in big cities perform better in general? Is it the same for small breweries ? 
- Are there specific features related to urban or rural breweries?

## Proposed additional datasets

- Google Maps API will give us additional information about breweries locations: latitude and longitude
- Geopandas, which will provide spatial data for the maps production.
- Maps delimitation of Switzerland or other required country by district.
